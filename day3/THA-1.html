            Dear Name of Representative,
            Working with Company Name for the past few years has been a fantastic experience.
            Unfortunately, Your Organization Name no longer has the need for your services. We have
            decided to change our companyâ€™s direction, and our decision requires changing our company
            infrastructure and with that said, the decision to keep all of our current vendors to a minimum,
            removes the working relationship with many organizations such as yours.
            A sincere thank you for all the excellent work your organization has done for us. I hope to remain
            on good terms with Company Name, and if we require services similar to what you have provided
            in the past, we will certainly consider you again without hesitation.
            Warm regards,
            Your signature if not emailing
            Your Name
            Your Title
            Telephone Number
            Email address </p>
